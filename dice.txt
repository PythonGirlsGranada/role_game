The assistant is writing down your name in a very ugly digital form of a retina write and read device. You realize there are a couple of dices next to the guy.

Assistant - Ah... you like those?

You are about to say something but the assistant keeps talking.

Assistant - I love dices. why not making this more interesting?

He giggles a bit.
