You suddenly realizes you are speaking to someone. Ugh what happened? probably you are just tired and fell a bit sleep standing up.

? - Hey! hey you. I'm talking to you, you need to help me fill this form up.

You look up, you are standing up in front of a weird guy with cheap glasses and a white lab coat. He has a worn out plaque saying "Assistant", the poor guy doesn't even wear a name on it. He's nerviously hitting the stand table with his pen.

You look around ignoring the impatient guy for a moment. It looks like a waiting room, a very boring one. There's neon light coming from the crystal door, changing colour, also shadows. Ah, now you remember, you were there due to a loss of memory problem. That was a clinic, not far away from your appartment.

Assistant - Hello? I'm still waiting. I know you are sick or somthing but please.

You look back again to the guy. You don't want to explain your forgetfulness, so you just say...

You - Ah, yes.

Quite... talkactive you were there.
